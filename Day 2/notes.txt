BUNDLERS: vite, parcel, webpack
parcel: a JS package, to get this we need an package manager 
npm: a package manager 
npm install parcel -D , installing as dev-dependency 
^2.8.2 means auto-upgrade if newer version comes up
package-lock, locks the version
Never touch package-lock and node modules
   
The older way of getting React into our app is not the best practice,
as if the version changes or server goes down, it increases our work.
So..

npm install react 
npm install react-dom

npm => execute with npm

npx parcel index.html
